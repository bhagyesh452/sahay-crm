                    <p>I understand that due to government regulations and portals, I have no objections if the process takes longer than initially committed, as it reflects the standard functioning of government schemes.</p>
                    <p>I acknowledge that Start-Up Sahay Private Limited is a private entity and will communicate directly with the client under its own identity. Start-Up Sahay will not operate anonymously or hide its identity during communications. I am aware that any disputes related to direct communication will not result in refunds. If direct communication is to be avoided, I will inform Start-Up Sahay Private Limited in advance and take responsibility for relaying information to the client.</p>
                    <p>As me and my client are unfamiliar with the process, I authorize Start-Up Sahay Private Limited to submit the online or offline application in the concerned department on my client's behalf, if required.</p>
