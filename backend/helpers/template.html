              PRIVATE LIMITED has charged fees for providing comprehensive
              assistance in creating and developing the necessary documents and
              content required for application for the above-mentioned

            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> 2. Approval Criteria: </strong>
              The approval or rejection of applications is subjected to the
              specific criteria and guidelines outlined by each government
              scheme. START-UP SAHAY PRIVATE LIMITED cannot guarantee the
              success of any application, as it is contingent on the evaluation
              and decision of the relevant government authorities.

              <strong> 3. Government Fees: </strong>
              I understand that government authorities do not charge any fees
              for processing applications related to the schemes in which
              START-UP SAHAY PRIVATE LIMITED is assisting me. However, in the
              event that the government initiates fees or declares charges for
              the application process, I acknowledge that I will be liable to
              pay such fees.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong> 4. Client Responsibility: </strong>
              I understand that any fees or charges mentioned during the
              application process are specifically for the services provided by
              START-UP SAHAY PRIVATE LIMITED and are beyond the control of both
              the government and the consultancy. As the client, I am
              responsible for any such fees associated with the application
              process.

              I enter into this agreement with START-UP SAHAY PRIVATE LIMITED
              with full awareness, comprehension, and without any misconception
              about the nature of the services provided, the associated charges,
